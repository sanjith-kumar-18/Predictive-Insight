# Predictive Insight

Predictive Insight is a system developed for ESP8266 microcontrollers to enable real-time monitoring and analysis of environmental data. This system gathers crucial information such as temperature, humidity, gas, and noise levels, transmitting it efficiently to a ThingSpeak channel for remote access and comprehensive examination.

## Features

- **Data Collection**: Captures real-time environmental metrics including temperature, humidity, gas, and noise.
- **Wi-Fi Connectivity**: Establishes a stable connection to a Wi-Fi network for seamless data transmission.
- **ThingSpeak Integration**: Sends collected data to a ThingSpeak channel for remote monitoring and analysis.
- **Threshold-based Control**: Includes conditional controls triggered by temperature variations to manage an output pin, ensuring swift responses to environmental changes.

## Getting Started

To begin using Predictive Insight, follow these steps:

1. **Hardware Setup**: Connect the ESP8266 microcontroller according to the provided guidelines.
2. **Software Installation**: Upload the provided code to the microcontroller using the Arduino IDE or similar software.
3. **Configuration**: Update the Wi-Fi credentials and ThingSpeak API keys in the code to match your network settings and channel information.
4. **Deployment**: Power up the system and monitor the data transmission to the ThingSpeak channel.
